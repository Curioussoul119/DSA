Method 1 (Simple : O(n3)): 
We can consider all substrings one by one and check for each substring
 whether it contains all unique characters or not. 
 There will be n*(n+1)/2 substrings. Whether a substring contains all
 unique characters or not can be checked in linear time by scanning it
 from left to right and keeping a map of visited characters.
 Time complexity of this solution would be O(n^3).
